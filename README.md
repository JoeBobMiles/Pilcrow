# Â¶ PILCROW

Pilcrow is a project to create a straight forward, single input, multiple output
formatting language. The primary idea is to create a language that is easy to
write like Markdown, but gives the author a large amount of control like LaTeX.

Inspired by Pandoc, Pollen, and LaTeX, Pilcrow is intended to fill a niche that
none of the aforementioned seem to be able to satisfy: writing documents that
can be published anywhere and still look nice.
